# Claude Project Context: Solo Game MVP (Godot 4.4)

## üß± ENGINE & LANGUAGE
- Engine: **Godot 4.4**
- Language: **GDScript**
- File extensions: `.gd`, `.tscn`, `.tres`
- All code must use **Godot 4+ syntax** and APIs. Do NOT use Godot 3 patterns (e.g., `yield()` or old signal syntax).
- Use `@onready`, `@export`, `create_tween()`, and other G4-native features.
- Assume GDScript 2.0 unless otherwise noted.

## üß≠ PROJECT STRUCTURE
- Scenes: `res://scenes/`
- Scripts: `res://scripts/`
- UI: `res://scenes/ui/`
- Assets: `res://assets/` (with subfolders like `characters`, `music`, `sfx`)
- Character animations are sprite-based. Use `AnimatedSprite2D` or `AnimationPlayer` only.

## ‚öîÔ∏è GAME TYPE
- Turn-based 2D RPG with QTE mechanics
- MVP goal: Combat vs a single boss enemy
- Characters are controlled via UI or single keypress (Z/X/C input split)

## ‚úÖ WHEN WRITING CODE:
- **Only write code compatible with Godot 4.4**
- **NEVER use Godot 3 syntax**
- **NEVER assume plugins or assets exist unless I tell you**
- Only add **small, focused features**‚Äîpreserve existing working behavior
- DO NOT generate full files unless explicitly told‚Äîassume I'm working incrementally

## üß† WHEN UNCERTAIN:
- Ask me before generating code that modifies multiple systems

## Development Guidelines

### Godot Version
- **Target Version**: Godot 4.x
- Always ensure code compatibility with Godot 4 API
- Key differences from Godot 3:
  - `get()` method only accepts one parameter - use `obj.get("property") if "property" in obj else default_value` instead of `obj.get("property", default_value)`
  - Updated node path syntax and method names
  - New typing system requirements

### Code Style
- Follow existing project conventions
- Maintain consistency with surrounding code


  ## Animation System
  - Use AnimationBridge for complex animations
  - All combat animations are in "testing animations.tscn"
  - Basic attacks use: windup ‚Üí QTE ‚Üí result animation ‚Üí cleanup

  ## Before Executing 
  - Ask me clarifying questions to ensure we get it right first try. 


  ## Golden Rule
  The Golden Rule: LOOK ‚Üí PROPOSE ‚Üí CONFIRM ‚Üí EXECUTE
1. LOOK FIRST, ALWAYS

"I should also check your TurnManager.gd to understand how this connects"
Never assume the user knows the project well, or anything about code - he doesn't.

2. PROPOSE CHANGES CLEARLY

Show what I found in the current code
Outline specific changes I'm proposing with clear reasoning
Identify which file(s) need updates
Consider scalability: "This will work for your MVP and scale when you add more enemies"
One focused proposal - don't overwhelm with multiple options

3. CONFIRM BEFORE PROCEEDING

Wait for Phil's approval: "Does this approach sound good? Any questions before I implement it?"
Answer any clarifying questions Phil has about the proposal
Get explicit go-ahead: "Proceed with the update" or similar confirmation


5. KEY PRINCIPLES

Phil knows nothing about coding - explain technical decisions simply
MVP focus - prioritize working game over perfection
Modular when it matters - build reusable systems if they'll be used 3+ times
One task at a time - complete each change fully before moving to the next
Step-by-step confirmation - check that Phil completed each step

6. FORBIDDEN ACTIONS

‚ùå Never update code without explicit approval
‚ùå Never assume current code state
‚ùå Never give 5+ questions at once (Phil will derail)
‚ùå Never implement without showing the plan first


7. SUCCESS PATTERN
‚úÖ "Let me check your current EnemyAI.gd..."
‚úÖ [Fetch current code]
‚úÖ "I propose adding smart target selection that prioritizes low-HP players. This means updating the target selection logic in lines 20-25. Sound good?"
‚úÖ [Wait for approval]
‚úÖ "Proceeding with the update..."
‚úÖ [One-shot perfect implementation]
RESULT: working code in 1-2 exchanges instead of debugging loops.
